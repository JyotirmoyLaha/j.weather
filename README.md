# 🌦️ J.SkyCast – Weather Web Application

A modern and visually rich **weather web application** that displays real-time weather and air quality data using a public weather API.  
Built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, with a strong focus on **UI/UX, animations, and real-world API handling**.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://j-weather.onrender.com

## 📌 About the Project

J.SkyCast was built to explore how real-world weather applications work internally, including:

- Fetching live data from external APIs
- Handling asynchronous JavaScript operations
- Managing UI states (loading, success, error)
- Dynamically updating visuals based on weather conditions

The project is fully frontend-based and does not use any frameworks or backend services.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 Search weather by city name
- 📍 Fetch weather using live location (Geolocation API)
- 🌡️ Real-time temperature & “feels like” data
- 🌬️ Wind speed & direction
- 💧 Humidity, pressure, visibility & precipitation
- ☀️ UV Index with risk level
- 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI)
  - EPA standard
  - AQI score & status
  - Pollutants: CO, NO₂, O₃
- 🎨 Dynamic background & animations based on:
  - Weather condition (rain, clouds, clear, etc.)
  - Day / Night mode
- ⏳ Loading indicators with contextual messages
- ⚠️ User-friendly error handling
- 📱 Fully responsive design

🧠 What I Learned

Working with real-world APIs and handling failures

Using async / await for asynchronous operations

Managing different UI states in frontend applications

Implementing dynamic UI changes based on API data

Improving user experience through animations and feedback

Understanding how small UX details impact usability

⚠️ Challenges Faced

Handling API errors and invalid city names

Managing location permission errors

Synchronizing UI animations with data updates

Balancing performance with heavy visual effects

These challenges helped me build a more user-focused and resilient frontend application.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add multi-day weather forecast

Improve performance optimization

Refactor JavaScript for better maintainability

Add accessibility improvements

Enhance weather-based background effects
